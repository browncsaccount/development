# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://browncsaccount.github.io/development`

### Goal and Value of the Application
This application works as an interactive interface for the Cave, a vinyl store for a myriad of albums. Users are able to filter the store's catalog by genre or decade as well as sort the catalog by price, album name, and artist name. Additionally, users can add or remove any product from the Cave in a list of Favorites.

### Usability Principles Considered


### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes
The user triggers state changes when performing the following actions: adding/removing from Favorites, changing any of the filter fields, and modifying the sort type.
